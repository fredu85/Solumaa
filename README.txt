This is my first "real" project so naturally I have learned alot.
TLDR: Planning, Inheritance, UI, Scriptable objects, events, single responsibility principle architecture.

The biggest lesson I have learned is the importance of planning.
Initially I thought it was enough to have a general idea of where to go 
with the game but I can now see that the better way would have been to
have a very specific plan and iterate upon that plan.

Before this project I never actually used inheritance in unity before,
mostly because previous projects were very small in scope and there was no real need for it.

While I had done UIs before I think with this project I had to step it up. Most of the game
is technically played through the UI so it was much more important. Scaling, positioning,functionality etc.

Instead of using singletons I decided after watching a GDC talk about scriptable objects to instead make
use of them for all the data that needed to be stored from scene to scene. The objects/prefabs
are now modular, meaning that(hopefully) you can input them into any scene and they do not require other
objects to work.

Initially I did not know about the single responsibility principle, but ever since 
I have been trying to incorporate it as much as possible. In hindsight, it could have been avoided
by better planning, but then I did not know what I know now.

There are probably much more I have learned during this project, but these are the most important lessons so far.
